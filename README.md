### What is this?

A data visualization project developed with a team of journalists for [theblacksea.eu](theblacksea.eu).

See a live version at [theblacksea.eu/eurocrimes](http://theblacksea.eu/eurocrimes/)

### What's inside?
A single page website built on the skeleton boilerplate featuring diagrams made with D3.js

### Is there something useable in this repository?
Yes, actually. There are four types of diagrams I've built for this project. Feel free to use them for your own projects.

* Chord diagram
* Map chart
* Bar chart
* Percentages chart

There's also a map of Europe in TopoJSON format which you can use independently of what's in this repo.

Each country has a basic data set which you can access. Here's what Spain's data looks like:

~~~~~
"properties": {
  "NAME": "Spain",
  "CONTINENT": "Europe",
  "REGION_UN": "Europe",
  "SUBREGION": "Southern Europe",
  "EU_MEMBER": "1"
}

Shape geometry is simplified while retaining a decent amount of detail and weighs just 90k.
