        <p>Poor education, lack of social mobility, and low incomes in Romania drive many to seek fortune abroad. But instead some turn to crime. Many Romanians who are law-abiding at home, become criminals abroad </p>

        <p>When we look at the number of criminals as a percentage of their expat population, Romania does not come in the top spot - that belongs to Lithuania</p>

        <p>The size of the prison population across the 27 states that have been or became EU members has remained almost static between 2002 and 2014. This oscillated between 60,000 and 65,000 for every year, according to Council of Europe figures</p>
        <p>This reveals that changes in the migrant population across the EU in the last 14 years have not led to an increase in convictions</p>
        <p class="quote">“There are so many different forms of immigration and waves of people who migrate and under different circumstances and how well received they are in society or how prepared that society is, so it’s impossible to say whether this leads to less or more crime. We have to look at circumstances and different conditions in which immigration is taking place. It can lead to both outcomes.” Cristian Walburg, doctor in Criminal Science at Westphalian Wilhelm University, Munster.</p>
